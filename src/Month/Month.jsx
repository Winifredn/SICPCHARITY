          Cooperatives in Pandemics, Food Security, War conflict and Climate
          Issues in Africa Cooperatives have an important role in increasing
          community resilience to climate change, wars, conflicts, and
          pandemics. According to the seventh principle of cooperatives,
          "Concern for Community," cooperatives should have concern for not just
          their shareholders but in addition the community around them during
          times of crisis. The latest exceptional global issues, including as
          the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine-Russia war, international
          conflicts, environmental destruction, and the energy and food
          collapse, have had a negative impact on society and necessitate
          ongoing joint responses. African cooperatives have helped to
          facilitate climate change adaptation and mitigation by supporting,
          among other things, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement on
          greenhouse gas reductions (ICA, 2023). Cooperatives are more connected
          to people's needs and have systems and processes in place that can
          identify climate change victims and provide targeted adaptation and
          mitigation strategies. The cooperative movement engages its members
          and prospective members in sustainable resource management and the
          selection of suitable projects.

          Concerning pandemics, the cooperative movement promotes the creation
          of robust measures to mitigate the disastrous impacts of pandemics.
          Several countries implemented stringent steps to combat the spread of
          COVID-19, particularly during the period when it was most prevalent.
          These initiatives had varying effects on people's livelihoods and
          different sectors of the African economy. Among other things, the
          effects included lower demand and supply of goods and services, higher
          adoption of internet-based services, less productivity in agriculture,
          higher levels of food insecurity, and the shutdown of businesses.
          Notwithstanding these consequences, numerous cooperatives continued to
          operate while offering humanitarian assistance to their members and
          nearby populations (ICA, 2023).

          {" "}
          On the other side, certain African countries are still experiencing
          instability as a result of conflicts and wars. These wars have
          resulted in the collapse or reduction of corporate activities,
          displacement, low social cohesiveness, inadequate leadership
          structures and procedures, widespread poverty, joblessness, and
          inequality, all of which contribute to unrest and destabilization.
          Governments and cooperative movements in war-torn nations have since
          shifted their focus to mediation and reconciliation (ICA, 2023). In
          this context, the African cooperative movement as a social and
          commercial model focuses on reducing risk for marginalised and
          disadvantaged populations by facilitating social protection efforts
          and identifying reliable and appropriate business prospects.
          Furthermore, they seek to bring back peace in conflict zones. Another
          major issue confronting most African countries is food insecurity.
          There are several cooperatives in Africa, particularly agricultural
          ones that seek to promote food security for not only their members but
          additionally those nearby (ICA, 2023). More importantly, the African
          continent is packed with resources that have never been used to their
          full potential including fertile and virgin lands, water, and human
          resources for which cooperatives can utilize to make difference in
          food security issues on the continent.
