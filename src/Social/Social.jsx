          Cooperatives As A Path Way to The Women Sustainable Livelihoods and
          Empowerment

          Over the past two centuries cooperatives had been introduced to the
          world and ever since, the term cooperative has been developed in
          various form in different sectors in which human survival activities
          take places, meaning the environment of socio-economic and political
          aspect. They are usually an association of organized groups of people,
          organizations, or countries who/which share same values and
          objectives, willing to work together in order to achieve a defined or
          shared vision. The roots of cooperatives historically are traced in
          Europe in 19th century as their origin before they spread to other
          developed countries. Undoubtedly, the creation and growth of these
          cooperatives was portrayed as a tool to eradicate the delicate
          situation of absolute poverty and to advance country’s economy. It is
          simply and normal to find cooperatives in different sectors like
          agriculture, mineral, industries and service sectors as they are
          entrusted in performing an excellent role of enhancing the livelihoods
          of rural residents in many developing countries.

          Kenya as one of African countries to have cooperatives’ development
          long history in comparison to other sub-Saharan and east African
          countries like Rwanda, has proven cooperatives to be the driver of its
          growth, and indicated that they have made the main contributions to
          the overall economy after its independence. In 2009, the Kenya
          Ministry of Development and Marketing confirmed that 80% of Kenya’s
          citizen was earning its income from cooperatives’ practices directly
          or indirectly. In 2004, it was highlighted that in Africa; not less
          than 40% of the families are affiliated in cooperative communities
          (Schwettmann, 2004). In Rwanda particularly there are 10,981
          cooperatives registered currently with 5,293,090 members (Rwanda
          Cooperative Agency, 2022) who make also the 40 percent of the whole
          Rwanda population of 13 Million (World Bank, 2022). In this respect
          the cooperative movement is regarded to be the continent important

          governmental organisation (NGO). An International Labour Organisation
          (ILO) reports in 1998 highlighted that cooperatives lift up a huge
          package in economic growth and job creation promotion. This because
          cooperatives are production companies in which their members create
          their own employment, as well as services’ providers to their members.
          This signifies that cooperatives can also be influential and plays a
          crucial role in many state economies of developing countries
          especially in Africa. Based on the statistics of ILO study in 1997, it
          was estimated that in 15 African countries the cooperative sector was
          the main source of around 160000 direct jobs created (Wanyama,
          Develtere & Pollet 2008), later on in 2015 cooperatives have
          accomplished a significant contribution to the economy of Africa by
          forging 5.6 million jobs and 2.1 million cooperative led occupations
          (ICA, 2022). This indicates that cooperatives avail opportunities in
          job creation which is also really important in poverty reduction and
          sustainable livelihood for the cooperatives members, who may get
          direct wage employment from secondary and primary cooperatives as well
          as those who earn decent income from the self-employment generated
          through cooperatives.

          However cooperatives can also still create jobs to cooperative
          non-member through spillover effect of cooperatives’ activities based
          on transactions and opportunities created by cooperatives that is
          additionally crucial to the overall country economy. Despites the
          opportunity of job creation, the importance and contribution of
          cooperatives in forging jobs have been forsaken by cooperative
          promoter agencies, planners of jobs, social partners and non profit
          organisation (Schwettmann, 2004). Nevertheless, when considering the
          context of Rwanda which is one of the sub-Saharan land-locked
          countries in central east Africa. In this small hilly country,
          Cooperatives arose from the colonial government’s efforts to establish
          structures for policy implementation. Cooperatives were still used
          after independence, as the new established government accepted them as
          instruments for enacting policies and development objectives. This
          autonomous government, in particular, saw cooperatives as institutions
          that would meet the subsistence requirements of its stakeholders
          instead of being seen as economic entities (Espérance Mukarugwiza &
          ILO, 2010). This placed cooperative members to governmental control,
          impeding the development of cooperatives as economic entities that
          suit the needs and interests of its members. The period of civil wars
          from 1990 to 1994 in Rwanda further hampered cooperatives growth by
          undermining all socioeconomic activities in the country.

        <p>
          However after 1994, the new government took over and set structural
          transformation in various sectors of socio-economic and political
          activities that had resulted into boom of many economic spheres as
          well as high increase in cooperatives creation in Rwanda. This is
          evidenced by statistics from Rwanda Cooperative Agency (2022) which
          reported that in Rwanda there are a total number of 10,981 registered
          cooperatives in which agriculture sector covers 45.9%, services sector
          covers 16.6%, the trading sector cover 15.3%, and handicraft covers
          10.8% while the financial sector and other remaining sectors cover
          11.4%. It is further reported that cooperatives play a significant
          role in poverty reduction, creating jobs, access to market, food
          security, building capacity and the overall development of Rwandans.
          In addition they are seen as the best model to achieve financial
          inclusion and other socio-economic development aspects. It is evident
          that all the aforementioned facts from cooperatives intervention
          combined together can be the source of rural sustainable livelihood in
          gender context when considering the disadvantaged population in rural
          areas especially women who rarely participate in many of development
          activities based on various facts including extreme poverty, being
          blocked by cultural and social right in they are silenced by high
          pressure of men surroundings as well inability to economic access.
          Such assumption of cooperatives potentials might be supported by the
          case of India as an example, in which the country’s first women
          cooperative federation has risen from 33 to 103 member cooperatives of
          various types and sizes where member cooperatives’ collective income
          has levelled up 295% since 2005, and 65,985 women have improved and
          increased livelihoods whereas in country like Philippines 1.4 million
          individuals and over 7.2 million dependants are safeguarded under
          micro insurance policies and among these policyholders more than 70%
          are women (Jo‐Anne Ferguson, 2012) who frequently perceived to be
          marginalized.
