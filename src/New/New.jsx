        <h1>The importance of Preserving and Conserving Green Grassland</h1>
        <p>
          Globally, over-utilization of resources and climate change have caused
          increasingly serious ecological damage, including but not limited to
          losses of biodiversity and ecosystem stability, threatening the
          sustainability of ecological functions and services. In 2021, the
          United Nations launched the “United Nations Decade on Ecosystem
          Restoration” plan. Grasslands, the most important terrestrial
          ecosystem, account for more than 40% of the total land area, and
          around 1 billion people worldwide live on grassland. However, more
          than 49% of the grasslands are degraded. It is imperative to recognize
          and understand the important functions of grassland ecosystems in
          regulating the climate, improving the environment and maintaining the
          ecological balance. Exploring the ecological restoration techniques of
          degraded grasslands helps broaden our horizons and provides solutions
          for human beings to combat degrading ecosystems. SICP
