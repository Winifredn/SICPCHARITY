              The Solidarity Initiative for Children and People (SICP) is a
              Charity Non-profit and Non-governmental organization established
              in Rwanda in 2023. Our main aim is to help poor and marginalized
              people who suffer from various life-imposed uncertainties. We
              offer encouragement and support through charity activities,
              empowerment, and spiritual guidance, focusing primarily on
              children, as well as other vulnerable groups such as women,
              widows, unaccompanied hospital patients, and refugees within the
              East-African region. While our roots are in Rwanda, our reach
              extends beyond borders as we continue to expand. Many children,
              left-behind women, and others need our support. Together, we can
              make an unforgettable and huge positive impact on the lives of
              these less fortunate individuals. We believe that by joining
              hands, we can eradicate poverty and end global suffering. We
              invite you to work with us in this noble cause.

              Anyone who believes in our mission and values can contribute to

              A donator of SICP is everyone who has understood the goal and
              value of our organization and decides to support our agenda and
              charity activities. A donator from his/her kind heart and capacity
              can either support our community financially or through essentials
              kits provision. We have many children today who lack many basic
              needs either in their homes and school life, and want support from
              you. Children are angels and leaders of tomorrow, as we take into
              account this statement, letâ€™s nourish our minds that the best
              leaders of tomorrow are cultivated from the early cared childhoods
              with good education and healthy life, therefore this is where your
              role comes into play by helping to strengthen the cared childhood
              stage. With your kind heart, you can choose to donate today from
              your capacity. If for example you donate only $50 every month to a
              kindergarten child, he/she will be able to eat, cloth and study
              well. If it is for a primary school child, only a $100 every
              trimester or $300 for three trimesters will help him/her to study,
              eat and cloth well. In addition for a high school child, only $160
              every trimester or $480 for three trimesters, can help him/her
              study, eat and cloth. Moreover a $250 might help to change a young
              girl or boy and a left behind woman life from marginalized
              families; as such amount could act as a capital to start a small
              business that can generate income to them saving them from being
              beggars in the streets.

            Poverty, disease, homelessness, hunger, disasters, and refugee
            crises negatively impact individuals and families worldwide,
            hindering sustainable development. The COVID-19 outbreak left many
            devastated, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa where extreme
            suffering became widespread. Founded in 2023 as a non-governmental
            organization, SICP Charity strives to bring hope and support to
            those in need. We mobilize resources to combat poverty,
            malnutrition, and poor education for children. Additionally, we
            support and encourage women's empowerment. Our mission is to address
            these challenges and create positive change. Through dedicated
            efforts, we aim to build a world where everyone has access to basic
            necessities, quality education, and opportunities for growth and
            development.
