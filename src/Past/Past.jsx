        <p>
          We plan to visit and Assist the unaccompanied patients at MUHIMA
          Hospital. We will help the patients to take showers and change to new
          clothes. We will also give those words of encouragement and hope to
          help them not to feel lonely and left. Furthermore we will provide
          foods, snacks, and some pocket money to buy medications to those
          patients who are unable to afford hospital bills.
